I am Teodor and I study Biomedical Engineering and IT at Uppsala University. My interests lie in technology or engineering which has intrigued me since my childhood. For that and few other reasons is why pursuing further knowledge in an engineering field is to me a natural choice. I want to be part of the development process and keep up with the fast progress. Hence why I am looking into what my options are for a doctorate, although in practice that is still a few years away.

I also have a passion for music and I am part of a student orchestra (a big band (jazz) of which I am part of the directorate), another band that writes our own songs and occasionally a few other musical groups. I also take lessons in Lindy Hop.

I spend most of my time on studies and on my spare time I do music, engage in social online gaming with friends and family. I also learn languages for fun and I have a couple of minor projects of my own in progress like making my own instruments or programming something or a music project. I also really enjoy windsurfing in the summer and snowboarding when we are one the opposite side of the sun.
